## Design

### Colors

- Blue: Often associated with healthcare, blue evokes feelings of trust, security, and calmness. It is a universally liked color and can be effectively used as a primary color in your design.
- Green: This color symbolizes health, tranquility, and nature. It is comforting to the eyes and can be used to highlight key areas like call-to-action buttons or important information.
- White: A backdrop of white space promotes clarity and reduces visual clutter, making information more digestible. It also gives the website a clean and professional look.
- Accent Colors: Subtle shades of orange or teal can be used for accents. Orange evokes warmth and friendliness, while teal represents healing and sophistication.

### Fonts

For the fonts, readability and accessibility should be your priority:

#### Serif Fonts

Serif fonts like Georgia or Times New Roman are often associated with trustworthiness and authority. These can be used for headlines or calls to action to draw attention and give a sense of reliability.

#### Sans-Serif Fonts

For body text, sans-serif fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, or Roboto are excellent for digital platforms due to their clean and modern appearance, which enhances readability on screens.
